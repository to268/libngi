# Build
To build the library, you will need: the make package, with a C compiler
(gcc is the only tested compiler) and a good C library.
Porting the library will be easier in the future.

# Generating docs
To generate docs, you will need: doxygen, texlive (optional) and to update git submodules

# Testing
To run the test suite, you will need valgrind and to checkout the utest.h submodule
